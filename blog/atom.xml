        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're excited to announce that we finally have a prerelease version  of React Navigation 6. We released React Navigation 5 more than half a year ago, and it brought a lot of new possibilities with the new dynamic API, and was met with overwhelmingly positive reaction. Since then, we've been working on incremental improvements and refinements to the library and thinking about how to make it even better. This brings us to the next major version of React Navigation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exactly two years ago, we published the first stable version of React Navigation. Throughout this time, the library has been actively developed by adding  many new features and bug fixes. The essence of React Navigation was that it was a project that was to become not only a project of individual programmers adapting it to their requirements, but a community as a whole, hence the emphasis on versatility, extensibility, and the tendency to reconsider the assumptions if there were such needs. Thanks to this, the Library has been undergoing metamorphosis of both incremental and completely reorganized shape.]]></summary>
