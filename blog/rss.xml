            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The documentation is now live at <a href="https://reactnavigation.org">reactnavigation.org</a>, and v5 lives <a href="/docs/5.x/getting-started">here</a>.</p><p>React Navigation 6 keeps mostly the same core API as React Navigation 5, and you can think of it as further polishing what was in React Navigation 5. Let&#x27;s talk about the highlights of this release in this blog post.</p><h2>Highlights</h2><h3>More flexible navigators</h3><p>Navigators accept many of their customization options as props, which means we can’t customize them based on the active screen. To make this level of control possible, we needed to move these props to options that you can configure per screen.</p><p>In React Navigation 6, many of these props are now screen options. The most significant changes are <code>tabBarOptions</code> and <code>drawerContentOptions</code>, which now all live on <code>options</code> instead. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-js">// Before (v5)
&lt;Tab.Navigator
  tabBarOptions={{
    inactiveTintColor: &#x27;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)&#x27;,
    activeTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
    style: {
      position: &#x27;absolute&#x27;,
      borderTopColor: &#x27;rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)&#x27;,
    },
  }}
&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code class="language-js">// After (v6)
&lt;Tab.Navigator
  screenOptions={{
    tabBarInactiveTintColor: &#x27;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)&#x27;,
    tabBarActiveTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
    tabBarStyle: {
      position: &#x27;absolute&#x27;,
      borderTopColor: &#x27;rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)&#x27;,
    },
  }}
&gt;
</code></pre><p>See <a href="/docs/upgrading-from-5.x#deprecations">deprecations</a> for more details.</p><h3>Elements library</h3><p>We extracted some of the components and helpers used across various navigators in React Navigation and published them under a new package called <a href="/docs/elements"><code>@react-navigation/elements</code></a>. It can be useful if you&#x27;re building your own navigator, or just want to reuse some of the components in your app.</p><p>Currently only a small set of components are exported, but there are more to come.</p><h3>Simplified APIs for existing functionality</h3><p>We simplified many APIs with React Navigation 6 to address common use cases. For example:</p><ul><li>Single option to use a modal presentation style and transparent modal with <a href="/docs/stack-navigator#presentation"><code>presentation</code></a></li><li>Custom header doesn&#x27;t require setting <code>headerMode=&quot;screen&quot;</code> manually anymore</li><li>The <code>useHeaderHeight</code> hook now ignores hidden headers and returns the height of the closest visible header in parent</li><li>New option to set a <a href="/docs/bottom-tab-navigator#tabbarbackground">custom background</a> (such as <code>BlurView</code>) for tab bar without having to use a custom tab bar</li><li>New API to manage ref on the container <a href="/docs/navigating-without-navigation-prop">(<code>createNavigationContainerRef</code> and <code>useNavigationContainerRef</code>)</a></li></ul><h3>New <code>Group</code> component for organization</h3><p>The <a href="/docs/group"><code>Group</code></a> component helps you organize screens inside your navigators and share common <code>screenOptions</code> between the <code>Group</code>s.  Passing <code>screenOptions</code> to a group configures all the screens inside that group to use these options. You can override <code>Group</code> options by passing <code>options</code> to each Screen component, similar to how you can with <code>screenOptions</code> on Navigator. You can also nest <code>Group</code> components inside other <code>Group</code> components. They are lightweight and don’t render anything - like fragments, so they won’t affect performance.</p><p>In this code snippet, you can see that we group regular screens under one group and modal screens under another group:</p><pre><code class="language-js">function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Stack.Navigator&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Group&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Home&quot; component={HomeScreen} /&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Details&quot; component={DetailsScreen} /&gt;
      &lt;/Stack.Group&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Group screenOptions={{ presentation: &#x27;modal&#x27; }}&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen
          name=&quot;CreatePost&quot;
          component={CreatePostScreen}
        /&gt;
      &lt;/Stack.Group&gt;
    &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><h3>Headers by default in Bottom Tabs &amp; Drawer</h3><p>Developers often want to show a header for screens inside of drawers and bottom tabs. To do this, we had to nest a stack navigator which provides a header, even if it was a navigator with just one screen. So we now show headers by default in screens of drawer and bottom tabs. No nesting necessary.</p><p>We also export a <a href="/docs/elements#header"><code>Header</code></a> component in the new elements library to use anywhere in your components.</p><h3>Native navigation by default</h3><p>Historically, React Navigation has been mostly JS based, with animations and gestures written in JavaScript on top of <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code>, and <code>react-native-reanimated</code> or <code>Animated</code>. While this works for a lot of apps, apps with heavy screens can suffer from poor performance, and some native features are difficult to re-create exactly (such as the large header on iOS). So, we wanted to address this by using native primitives for navigation.</p><p>With React Navigation 5, we introduced <a href="/docs/native-stack-navigator"><code>@react-navigation/native-stack</code></a> package powered by <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens"><code>react-native-screens</code></a>, as well as a native backend for <a href="/docs/material-top-tab-navigator"><code>@react-navigation/material-top-tabs</code></a> powered by <a href="https://github.com/callstack/react-native-pager-view"><code>react-native-pager-view</code></a>.</p><p>In React Navigation 6, we made <code>@react-navigation/native-stack</code> the default choice for setting up Stack navigation. It uses <code>UINavigationController</code> on iOS and Fragments on Android to implement navigation natively. We also focused a lot on aligning the API of <code>@react-navigation/native-stack</code> with <code>@react-navigation/stack</code> so that it’ll be easier to switch between them.</p><blockquote><p>While <code>@react-navigation/native-stack</code> is now used as the default choice in the documentation, it doesn&#x27;t replace <code>@react-navigation/stack</code>. Both packages are maintained and are valid options for your projects. If you&#x27;re currently using <code>@react-navigation/stack</code>, you can keep using it. You don&#x27;t need to move to <code>@react-navigation/native-stack</code> unless you really want to.</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, we switched <code>@react-navigation/material-top-tabs</code> to use <code>react-native-pager-view</code> by default.</p><h3>Better type-safety</h3><p>React Navigation 5’s TypeScript support was much better than React Navigation 4; but, some things such as <code>useNavigation</code> were still untyped by default.</p><p>In React Navigation 6, you don’t need to annotate <code>useNavigation</code> to get autocompletion and type checking. This is possible by defining a type for the screens globally using declaration merging:</p><pre><code class="language-js">declare global {
  namespace ReactNavigation {
    interface RootParamList {
      Home: undefined;
      Profile: { userId: string };
      NotFound: undefined;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>You can read <a href="/docs/typescript#specifying-default-types-for-usenavigation-link-ref-etc">more about it in our TypeScript docs</a>.</p><h3>Flipper plugin</h3><p>Our new <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a> plugin includes similar functionality to the currently available Redux Devtools Extensions integration. You can see all navigation actions, and jump back and forth between earlier and new navigation states. In addition, it also includes a tab to test your linking configuration.</p><p>Since the dev tools is built from scratch, we’re now free to add new features to make debugging easier in future.</p><p>One advantage of the Flipper plugin over Redux Devtools Extension is that it doesn’t need Chrome Debugger to work. Since Chrome Debugger can sometimes affect performance and even potentially change behavior, we think this is a more reliable solution.</p><p><img src="/assets/devtools/flipper-plugin-logs.png" alt="React Navigation Logs"/></p><p><img src="/assets/devtools/flipper-plugin-linking.png" alt="React Navigation Linking"/></p><p>See the <a href="/docs/devtools#useflipper">guide for setting it up</a> for more details. Note that Flipper support in Expo managed apps requires a <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/clients/introduction/">Custom Development Client</a> and it does not work in Expo Go at the time of writing.</p><h2>Upgrading</h2><p>While React Navigation 6 doesn&#x27;t introduce changes of the same magnitude as React Navigation 5, there are still some breaking changes. It is possible, however, to mix packages from React Navigation 5 and React Navigation 6 (with a few caveats) so that you can gradually upgrade packages.</p><p>See the <a href="/docs/upgrading-from-5.x">upgrade guide</a> for a full list of changes and more details.</p><h2>Sponsor us</h2><p>If React Navigation helps you to deliver value to your customers, it&#x27;d awesome a lot if you could sponsor us. Sponsorships will help us to move more quickly towards our goal of building the best cross-platform navigation library and continue to provide timely support for bug reports in our GitHub issues.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/react-navigation">Visit our GitHub Sponsors page</a> 👈</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since then, we&#x27;ve been working on incremental improvements and refinements to the library and thinking about how to make it even better. This brings us to the next major version of React Navigation.</p><p>While React Navigation 5 was complete overhaul to the API of React Navigation, React Navigation 6 keeps the same API, with some breaking changes to make things more consistent and provide more flexibility. We also tried to address some common pain points and confusions that users had.</p><p>We&#x27;ll share few highlights of the release in this blog post.

It&#x27;s used by financial services apps like <a href="https://brex.com/mobile/">Brex</a> and <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a>; educational apps like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/mobile-app-download">Codecademy Go</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/mobile/">DataCamp</a>; consumer apps like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/shop">Shop from Shopify</a>, <a href="https://www.bloombergapps.com/app/bloomberg/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/taskrabbit-handyman-more/id374165361">TaskRabbit</a>, and <a href="https://www.th3rdwave.coffee/">Th3rdwave</a>; entertainment apps like the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/nfl/id389781154">National Football League (NFL)</a> (in their main app and several others), <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cameo-personal-celeb-videos/id1258311581">Cameo</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tracker-network-for-fortnite/id1287696482">Tracker Network for Fortnite</a>, and the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/app">Call of Duty companion app</a> from Activision Blizzard. One of my personal favourite apps using React Navigation is <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, I love making my coffee with <a href="https://singleoriginapp.com/">Single Origin 2</a>, and managing household chores with <a href="https://sweepy.app/">Sweepy</a>.</p><p>We&#x27;ve also seen React Navigation used in apps that help in the fight against COVID-19. Our favourites are <a href="https://howwefeel.org/">How We Feel</a> by Pinterest co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann and a team from Pinterest in collaboration with leading scientists (<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/how-we-feel-app-helps-track-spread-of-covid-19/">article</a>) and <a href="https://covid.joinzoe.com/">COVID Symptom Study</a> by ZOE Global in association with King&#x27;s College London (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-symptoms-app.html">article</a>).</p><p>There are so many more apps that we could mention here, but let&#x27;s move on. If you&#x27;ve been following along with React Navigation, you already know what a huge improvement v5 has been for the library and for navigation in React Native in general. We haven&#x27;t slowed down since shipping v5, some other substantial improvements we&#x27;ve shipped recently include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2020/05/16/web-support">First-class support for web</a> 🎉</li><li>The improvements to URL integration that made web support possible also drastically improves the experience of building deep linking in your iOS and Android apps! You can play around with route configuration directly in the browser with the <a href="/docs/configuring-links#playground">linking playground</a>.</li><li>An alternative stack navigator implementation that uses <code>UINavigationController</code> on iOS and <code>Fragment</code> on Android. There is no beating the performance of the native stack navigator equivalents (at least for now), and so we made them available through <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/tree/master/native-stack">createNativeStackNavigator</a> on <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens">react-native-screens</a>. You don&#x27;t get the same degree of customization with the native stacks, and there is no equivalent on web, so there are plenty of cases where you will still want to use <a href="/docs/stack-navigator/">createStackNavigator</a>. Your app, your choice. Mix and match if you want.</li></ul><h2>React Navigation Team</h2><p>This project has only been possible because of the time and money invested by <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a> and <a href="https://swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> to support contributors like the current lead maintainer <a href="https://github.com/satya164">Satyajit Sahoo</a> and others such as <a href="https://github.com/brentvatne">Brent</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ericvicenti">Eric</a>, <a href="https://github.com/EvanBacon">Evan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera">Krzysztof</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WoLewicki">Wojciech</a>.</p><p>Many folks from the community have also volunteered their valuable time to the project: <a href="https://github.com/osdnk">Michal Osadnik</a> was instrumental in designing and building React Navigation v5, <a href="https://github.com/eriveltonelias">Erivelton</a> has provided support and improved the documentation, <a href="https://github.com/vonovak">Vojtech</a> maintains popular React Navigation utility libraries and chips in on the library and documentation when he has time, and <a href="https://github.com/janicduplessis">Janic</a> regularly lives on the bleeding edge, testing new features and helping us improve them before they are included in stable releases and maintaining <a href="https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context">react-native-safe-area-context</a>, one of the building blocks for React Navigation.</p><p><code>@react-navigation/core</code> has reached over 300,000 downloads per week on npm, compared to 380,000+ for <code>react-native</code>. It&#x27;s not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions from npm download stats alone, but it is humbling to see React Navigation at nearly 80% of the weekly download count of React Native. We&#x27;ve managed this with an incredibly small team of, at most, one and a half full time engineers at any given time, and volunteers that chip in when they can.</p><h2>Sponsorship</h2><p>To be blunt: <strong>if React Navigation helps you to deliver value to your customers, we would be thrilled if you could show us some love through a sponsorship.</strong></p><p>Sponsorships will help us to move more quickly towards our goal of building the best cross-platform navigation library and continue to provide timely support for bug reports in our GitHub issues.</p><div style="margin-top:-30px"></div><h3>👉 <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/react-navigation">Visit our GitHub Sponsors page</a> 👈</h3><p>We appreciate any support you can provide, but please only donate if you have the financial means to do so comfortably!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>React Native has made cross-platform development much easier than before, and with React Native for Web, you can reuse code across Android, iOS and Web too!</p><p>One major pain point of reusing code for the web app has been navigation. React Navigation is one of the most widely used navigation libraries for React Native, but it didn’t support web. While you could run apps using React Navigation on the Web, a lot of things were missing, such as proper integration with URLs on the browser.</p><p>We have finally added preliminary web support to React Navigation. Let&#x27;s take a look at the changes.</p><h2>Integration with URLs in browsers</h2><p>The first step for web support is to have proper URL integration. This means:</p><ul><li>Users should be able to navigate to a screen in the app using a URL</li><li>URL in the browser&#x27;s address bar should update as users navigate in the app</li><li>Users should be able to go backwards and forwards using browser&#x27;s back/forward buttons</li><li>Buttons that navigate to other screens in the app should be links, and users should be able use standard shortcuts with them</li></ul><video playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" style="max-width:100%;margin-bottom:32px"><source src="/assets/blog/web-support/url-integration.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>In native apps, it&#x27;s already possible to navigate to a screen in the app using a URL via deep links. React Navigation can handle deep links if you provide a configuration in the <code>linking</code> prop of <code>NavigationContainer</code>. We now reuse the same configuration for URL integration in browsers. It also works for updating the URL in the browser when users navigates in the app. So if you have configured deep links in your app already, it&#x27;ll work with URL integration on the web without any changes 🥳</p><p>By default, we&#x27;ll reuse the route names as paths if you&#x27;ve provided <code>linking={{ enabled: true }}</code> without any extra configuration. However, you can also customize how the paths and params are parsed by providing mappings under the <code>config</code> property.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-js">const linking = {
  prefixes: [&#x27;https://mychat.com&#x27;, &#x27;mychat://&#x27;],
  config: {
    screens: {
      Home: &#x27;&#x27;,
      Profile: &#x27;:id/profile&#x27;,
      Settings: &#x27;:id/blog&#x27;,
    }
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;NavigationContainer linking={linking} fallback={&lt;SplashScreen /&gt;}&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Navigator&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Home&quot; component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Profile&quot; component={Profile} /&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Settings&quot; component={Settings} /&gt;
      &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
    &lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>We have a <a href="/docs/configuring-links/#playground">playground</a> where you can try custom configurations and see how it&#x27;s parsed. Give it a try, and we hope it&#x27;ll make it easier for you to configure links in your apps.</p><p>There&#x27;s a new <a href="/docs/link"><code>&lt;Link /&gt;</code> component</a> which lets you use URLs for navigation in the app.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-js">&lt;Link to=&quot;/profile/jane&quot;&gt;Go to Jane&#x27;s profile&lt;/Link&gt;
</code></pre><p>When you use this component, it renders anchor tags on the web. This means that users can use the same patterns that they are used to on the web, such as &quot;Open in new tab&quot;, &quot;Copy link address&quot; etc.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/osdnk">Michał</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WoLewicki">Wojciech</a> for their extensive work on URL integration.</p><h2>Improvements to the navigators</h2><p>URL integration isn&#x27;t enough to have proper web support. The navigators also need to feel at home on the web. We have made several improvements to the built-in navigators so that they behave as you expect on the web.</p><h3>Anchor tags in tabs and drawer</h3><p>The first change is using anchor tags. When you use built-in navigators such as drawer navigator and tab navigator, they render anchor tags for the drawer and tab items respectively when you have linking configured. This means that they behave the same as normal links on the web.</p><img src="/assets/blog/web-support/link-right-click.png" height="427"/><h3>No gestures and animations</h3><p>Another change is the removal of gestures on the web. Gestures are not commonly used on the web because they conflict with a lot of browser functionality and system gestures. For example, in Safari, you can swipe to go back to the previous page. Android has a system gesture to go back to previous pages too. Because of this, we&#x27;ve removed gestures on the web.</p><p>We&#x27;ve also disabled animations on the web by default since they are not commonly used and can be jarring, especially on larger screens. The animations in React Native Web also run entirely in JS, and tend not to be very performant on the web. So we&#x27;ve decided to disable them by default to better overall experience.</p><h3>Hide address bar on scroll</h3><p>Phones have small screens, so it&#x27;s important to maximize the use of available screen size. One of the ways mobile browsers achieve it is by hiding and showing the address bar when scrolling to give more vertical space to the content.</p><p>It&#x27;s especially important in case of the <a href="/docs/stack-navigator">stack navigator</a> because not only we have the browser&#x27;s address bar, but also the header at the top which is taking vertical space. Now we&#x27;ll automatically adjust the styles of the stack navigator to get this behavior without you having to write any special code.</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" style="max-width:100%"><source src="/assets/blog/web-support/hide-addressbar.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Permanent drawer</h3><p>Another way we can make maximum use of the available screen size is by making our UIs adapt to different screen sizes. For example, we may want to show a sidebar for navigation on large screens while switching to a drawer on smaller screens. You can now specify <code>drawerType</code> as <code>permanent</code> to show an always visible sidebar. See the <a href="/docs/drawer-navigator#drawertype">documentation for <code>drawerType</code></a> for example code on how to achieve it.</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" style="max-width:100%"><source src="/assets/blog/web-support/permanent-drawer.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/noemi_rozpara">Noemi</a> for implementing this feature.</p><h2>What&#x27;s next?</h2><p>This is just a start. We still need to figure out many things, such as SSR, handling of 404 etc. There is still a lot to do, but we’re excited to announce it and looking forward to feedback and bug reports.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href="/docs/web-support">documentation</a> to give it a try and let us know what you think. You can also <a href="https://react-navigation-example.netlify.app/">check the example app</a> to see a live demo of web support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exactly two years ago, we published the first stable version of React Navigation. Throughout this time, the library has been actively developed by adding  many new features and bug fixes. The essence of React Navigation was that it was a project that was to become not only a project of individual programmers adapting it to their requirements, but a community as a whole, hence the emphasis on versatility, extensibility, and the tendency to reconsider the assumptions if there were such needs. Thanks to this, the Library has been undergoing metamorphosis of both incremental and completely reorganized shape.</p><p>This led us to the moment when React Navigation became one of the most popular navigation solutions in React Native and we are incredibly proud of it.</p><p>Today is the day, when we want to mark this vision and major refactoring of the project, that has taken place over the last six months, as stable. One could say that this significant change concerned the core library, and therefore the API, which has been developed and made more dynamic.</p><h2>Highlights</h2><h3>Component based configuration</h3><p>In previous versions of React Navigation, we used to configure the navigator statically using <code>createXNavigator</code> functions and <code>static navigationOptions</code>. In React Navigation 5, all of the configuration happens inside a component and is dynamic.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-js">function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Stack.Navigator initialRouteName=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;settings&quot; component={Settings} /&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Screen
        name=&quot;profile&quot;
        component={Profile}
        options={{ title: &#x27;John Doe&#x27; }}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>This means we have access to props, state and context, and can dynamically change the configuration for the navigator!</p><p>We want to stress that this is the most important change. This seems to be just a difference in the API. It actually required reconsidering many of the assumptions made in React Navigation during the development of previous versions. The static API, known from previous versions may seem an easier and more obvious choice. In the current version, the navigation configuration is consistent with all patterns in the React community.
This made it necessary to rewrite the core of the library, which allowed us to make a number of improvements not only in this respect.</p><h3>New hooks</h3><p>Hooks are great for stateful logic and code organization. Now we have several hooks for common use cases:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/use-navigation"><code>useNavigation</code></a></li><li><a href="/docs/use-route"><code>useRoute</code></a></li><li><a href="/docs/use-navigation-state"><code>useNavigationState</code></a></li><li><a href="/docs/use-focus-effect"><code>useFocusEffect</code></a></li><li><a href="/docs/use-is-focused"><code>useIsFocused</code></a></li><li><a href="/docs/use-scroll-to-top"><code>useScrollToTop</code></a></li></ul><h3>Update options from component</h3><p>We’ve added a new <a href="/docs/navigation-prop#setoptions---update-screen-options-from-the-component"><code>setOptions</code></a> method on the <code>navigation</code> prop to make configuring screen navigation options more intuitive than its <code>static navigationOptions</code> predecessor. It lets us <strong>easily set screen options based on props, state or context without messing with params</strong>. Instead of using static options, we can call it anytime to configure the screen.</p><pre><code class="language-js">navigation.setOptions({
  headerRight: () =&gt; (
    &lt;DoneButton
      onPress={async () =&gt; {
        await saveNote();
        navigation.replace(&#x27;Notes&#x27;);
      }}
    /&gt;
  ),
})
</code></pre><p>It can be used for things like adding a button in the header which needs to interact with the screen state.</p><h3>New theming API</h3><p>In React Navigation, we had basic theming support where you could specify whether to use a light or dark theme. It wasn&#x27;t easy to customize the colors used by the built-in components such as header, tab bar etc. without extra code or repetition.</p><p>Now, we have revamped the <a href="/docs/themes">theme system</a> for easier customization. It is possible to provide a theme object with your desired colors for background, accent color etc. and it will automatically change the colors of all navigators without any extra code.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const MyTheme = {
  dark: false,
  colors: {
    primary: &#x27;rgb(255, 45, 85)&#x27;,
    background: &#x27;rgb(242, 242, 242)&#x27;,
    card: &#x27;rgb(255, 255, 255)&#x27;,
    text: &#x27;rgb(28, 28, 30)&#x27;,
    border: &#x27;rgb(199, 199, 204)&#x27;,
  },
};
</code></pre><h3>First-class types with TypeScript</h3><p>The new version has been written from the ground-up with TypeScript. We now get first class autocompletion and type-checking.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/announcing-5.0/typescript.gif" alt="TypeScript in action"/></p><p>We also have JSDoc for the built-in methods and options, so you get their description directly in your editor. See <a href="/docs/typescript">our typescript documentation</a> for more details on how to use it.</p><h3>Redux DevTools integration</h3><p>If you use <a href="https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger">React Native Debugger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension">Redux Devtools Extension</a>, you can see navigation actions in the devtools along with the current navigation state. It also supports time-travel debugging!</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/announcing-5.0/redux-devtools.gif" alt="Redux Devtools in action"/></p><p>You don&#x27;t need to use Redux in your apps for this to work and it works without any extra setup!</p><h3>Native Stack Navigator</h3><p>Traditionally, we have written our navigators in JavaScript for greater customizability. It fits a lot of use cases, but sometimes you want the exact native feel and the performance of native navigation. Now, we have added a new native stack navigator that uses native navigation primitives for navigation using the <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens"><code>react-native-screens</code></a> library. Under the hood, it just uses native components which might be obvious choice for native development and might be a good pick in the most cases.</p><img src="/assets/blog/android-native-stack.gif" height="530"/><img src="/assets/blog/ios-native-stack.gif" height="530"/><h3>Native backends for Material top tab navigator</h3><p>Similar to native stack, we also have <a href="/docs/material-top-tab-navigator#pager">new backends</a> for Material top tab navigator based on <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-viewpager"><code>react-native-viewpager</code></a> and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview"><code>ScrollView</code></a>.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import ViewPagerAdapter from &#x27;react-native-tab-view-viewpager-adapter&#x27;;

// ...

&lt;Tab.Navigator pager={props =&gt; &lt;ViewPagerAdapter {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
  {...}
&lt;/Tab.Navigator&gt;
</code></pre><p>or</p><pre><code class="language-js">import { ScrollPager } from &#x27;react-native-tab-view&#x27;;

// ...

&lt;Tab.Navigator pager={props =&gt; &lt;ScrollPager {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
  {...}
&lt;/Tab.Navigator&gt;
</code></pre><h3>Other improvements</h3><p>In addition to these larger improvements, there are several smaller improvements to fit more use cases and make it easier to do certain tasks:</p><ul><li>Revamped drawer navigator to make customizing the drawer sidebar content easier and more flexible.</li><li>Simpler API for <a href="/docs/navigation-prop#reset"><code>reset</code> action</a> where you can pass the new state directly instead of a chain of actions.</li><li>More reliable <a href="/docs/navigation-lifecycle"><code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events</a> to know when a screen&#x27;s focus state changes.</li><li>Integration with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/interactionmanager"><code>InteractionManager</code></a> to delay tasks until animation is complete.</li><li>Better safe area handling with <a href="https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context"><code>react-native-safe-area-context</code></a>.</li></ul><h2>Upgrading</h2><p>This is a big release and, while the basic concepts such as nesting are the same, the new API is mostly incompatible with the previous API. We know it can be a challenge to upgrade your code base. So we&#x27;re going to keep supporting React Navigation 4 with bug fixes. We&#x27;ll accept contributions and keep it compatible with the latest React Native version. The old code will now live in the <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/4.x">4.x branch</a> on GitHub.</p><p>We recommend starting your new projects with the new version so you can take advantage of the new APIs and the new features.</p><p>We have written an <a href="/docs/5.x/upgrading-from-4.x">upgrade guide</a> which will give you an overview of what&#x27;s changed and how to adapt the old API and concepts to the new API.</p><h2>A note for alpha users</h2><p>If you were using React Navigation 5 when it was alpha, you might need to check the following changes when upgrading:</p><ul><li>If you have added <code>@react-navigation/core</code> to your dependencies, remove it, and replace all imports from <code>@react-navigation/core</code> with <code>@react-navigation/native</code></li><li>If you were importing <code>NavigationNativeContainer</code>, change it to <code>NavigationContainer</code>, if you were using <code>NavigationContainer</code>, change it to <code>BaseNavigationContainer</code></li><li>If you had deep linking configured, the config format has changed for nesting. Check the <a href="/docs/deep-linking">deep linking docs</a> for details.</li></ul><h2>Thanks to these wonderful people</h2><p>React Navigation 5 wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without these wonderful people. A lot of thanks to <a href="https://github.com/osdnk">Michał Osadnik</a> for working in this project with me from idea to fruition, <a href="https://github.com/brentvatne">Brent Vatne</a> for his ideas, encouragement and funding from <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WoLewicki">Wojciech Lewicki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jakub-gonet">Jakub Gonet</a> for improving the documentation, and working on deep link support, <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera">Krzysztof Magiera</a> and <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion">Software Mansion</a> for their awesome libraries that the core functionality depends on and contributions, <a href="https://github.com/janicduplessis">Janic Duplessis</a> for <a href="https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context"><code>react-native-safe-area-context</code></a>.</p><p>Additionally, I would like to mention how important is the community&#x27;s influence on building this project. Without you, your support, your readiness to test and apply the next versions of the libraries, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible at all, and despite mentioning a few people by name, at no stage do we forget that this is a community activity and will respond to its needs. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work on such an unusual project, which facilitates the work of a large number of users.</p><p>Thanks again and hope you will find this release useful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a guest post by the <a href="https://reactnativepaper.com/">React Native Paper</a> team. If you like this guide, check out React Native Paper for more!</p><p>In this blog post, we&#x27;ll show you how to build a Twitter clone app using React Navigation v5 and Paper.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The React Navigation v5 comes with many great improvements compared to previous version. It not only provides a cross-platform native Stack, but also the API was redesigned from the ground up to allow things that were never possible before. Thanks to the component-based API, all of the configuration is happening inside the <strong>render method</strong>. This means we can access <strong>props</strong>, <strong>state</strong> and <strong>context</strong> and can <strong>dynamically change configuration</strong> for the navigator.</p><h3>What is React Native Paper?</h3><p><a href="https://reactnativepaper.com/">React Native Paper</a> is a UI component library that implements <a href="https://material.io/design/">MD Guidelines</a>.
It allows building beautiful interfaces on Mobile and Web with high-quality cross-platform components.
Furthermore, Paper provides you with a full <strong>theming support</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, <strong>RTL</strong> and it will take care of <strong>platform adaptation</strong>. This means you can focus on building apps with ready to use components instead of reimplementing the boring stuff.</p><p>In this guide, we would like to show you how to integrate React Navigation with Paper&#x27;s components. To show all the details of the integration we&#x27;ve decided to build a clone of Twitter. Of course, the functionalities will be very limited but the navigation part and main screens should look and feel similar.</p><p>In the following gif, you can see what is the final version of the app gonna looks like:</p><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-paper/final-app.gif" height="480"/><h2>Overview of the App</h2><p>Since original Twitter is a very complex app, we will build only a part of it. This means we will implement:</p><ul><li>Drawer</li><li>Stack Navigator with two screens: Screen showing bottom navigation and Details of a tweet</li><li>Bottom navigation with 3 tabs: Feed, Notifications, and Messages</li></ul><p>I will focus this guide on a React Navigation and React Native Paper integration. It means I won&#x27;t show you how to build all of the components necessary to create such an app, but you can always check the full implementation in the <a href="https://github.com/Trancever/twitterClone">github repo</a>.</p><p>Let&#x27;s get started!</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>I assume you already have an <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> project running locally. If not, make sure to create one. I chose Expo over plain React-Native because it includes most of the dependencies that we need so there is less work to do for us.</p><p>Let&#x27;s install React Native Paper, React Navigation v5 and other required dependencies.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-native-community/masked-view @react-navigation/drawer @react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs react-native-paper
</code></pre><p>In the next step we will make sure versions of these libraries are compatible.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
</code></pre><p>After you run these two commands you should be ready to go. Let&#x27;s start implementing the app!</p><h2>React Navigation and React Native Paper initial setup.</h2><p>Both these libraries require minimal setup.</p><p>In case of React Native Paper, we need to wrap the component tree with a <strong>Provider</strong>. You can do this inside the exported component in the <strong>App.js</strong> file.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from &#x27;react-native-paper&#x27;;
import Main from &#x27;./src/Main&#x27;;

export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;PaperProvider&gt;
      &lt;Main /&gt;
    &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>The <strong>PaperProvider</strong> provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components that need to be rendered at the top level. Check the full <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html">Getting-Started</a> page for more information.</p><p>React Navigation setup looks similar. There is a component called <strong>NavigationContainer</strong> which manages our navigation tree and contains the navigation state. It must wrap all navigator structure. We will render this component in <strong>App.tsx</strong> inside a <strong>PaperProvider</strong>. More information can be found in the official <a href="/docs/hello-react-navigation">documentation</a>.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from &#x27;react-native-paper&#x27;;
import { NavigationContainer } from &#x27;@react-navigation/native&#x27;;
import Main from &#x27;./src/Main&#x27;;

export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;PaperProvider&gt;
      &lt;NavigationContainer&gt;
        &lt;Main /&gt;
      &lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
    &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><h2>Drawer</h2><p>In our Twitter clone, we want to implement a Drawer that is available from any screen in the app. This means it has to be a topmost navigator.</p><p>In React Navigation v5 there is a common pattern for creating navigators. After importing <strong>createXNavigator</strong> function from the navigator package of your choice you can use <strong>Navigator</strong> and <strong>Screen</strong> components from the value it returns.</p><p>So let&#x27;s create a basic version of a Drawer:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { Text, View } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;;
import { createDrawerNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/drawer&#x27;;

const Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();

function DrawerContent() {
  return (
    &lt;View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: &#x27;center&#x27;, justifyContent: &#x27;center&#x27; }}&gt;
      &lt;Text&gt;Drawer content&lt;/Text&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}

function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    &lt;View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: &#x27;center&#x27;, justifyContent: &#x27;center&#x27; }}&gt;
      &lt;Text&gt;Home Screen&lt;/Text&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}

export const RootNavigator = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Drawer.Navigator drawerContent={() =&gt; &lt;DrawerContent /&gt;}&gt;
      &lt;Drawer.Screen name=&quot;Home&quot; component={HomeScreen} /&gt;
    &lt;/Drawer.Navigator&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><p>That&#x27;s what we see on a screen:</p><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-paper/simple-drawer.gif" height="480"/><p>We can open a drawer with a swipe gesture, it looks very smooth. However, the UI doesn&#x27;t look very impressive so let&#x27;s add more content to the drawer to make it look just like in the final version.</p><p>We will use:</p><ul><li><strong><em>DrawerContentScrollView</em></strong> and <strong><em>DrawerItem</em></strong> from <strong><em>@react-navigation/drawer</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Avatar</em></strong>, <strong><em>Text</em></strong> and <strong><em>Switch</em></strong> from <strong><em>react-native-paper</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong>DrawerContentScrollView</strong> component makes the drawer vertically scrollable and provides support for devices with notches, so it&#x27;s highly recommended to use it even for custom drawers.</p><p><strong>Components from React Native Paper</strong> make a clean, material UI.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { View, StyleSheet } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;;

In case of this Twitter clone, we will use it to transition from a screen displaying a feed of tweets to the screen showing details of a tweet.</p><p>React Navigation v5 provides two implementations of a Stack Navigator</p><ul><li>Native Stack</li><li>JS-based Stack</li></ul><p>The main difference between them is that JS-based stack re-implements animations and gestures while the native stack navigator relies on the platform primitives for animations and gestures.</p><p>In this section, we will integrate React Native Paper <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/appbar-header.html">Appbar</a> and JS-based Stack Navigator.</p><p>As a first step, we will create a minimal version of a Stack:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

We can achieve that by passing an <code>Appbar.Header</code> component as a <code>header</code> in Stack&#x27;s <code>screenOptions</code>. We will also pass a <code>headerMode</code> prop with a value of <code>screen</code> to have a nice looking fade in/out animation.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

<strong>Previous</strong> property tells us if there are any other screens lower on the Stack.</p><br/> Finally, **navigation** property allows navigating to different screens e.g. opening a Drawer. <p>The thing that we haven&#x27;t covered yet and it is very important is how to actually navigate between Stack Navigator screens.
In case of Tab or Drawer Navigator, we get it out of the box. We can swipe to open/close the Drawer or press a tab to change the scene. In Stack, we have to implement it by ourselves.</p><p>React Navigation gives us many different ways to navigate, but we will mostly focus on <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>. You can access these two methods in <strong>navigation</strong> prop.</p><p>As the name suggests <code>push</code> method pushes the new screen on the stack and <code>pop</code> removes current screen from the stack.</p><p>As you can see on a snippet above, we invoke a <code>navigation.pop</code> function whenever user presses the back button in header. This means user will be allowed to come back from <strong>Details</strong> to the <strong>Feed</strong> screen.</p><p>We still need to implement an option to go from <strong>Feed</strong> to the <strong>Details</strong>.

    &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><h4>Combining themes</h4><p>Since both React Navigation and React Native Paper follows the same pattern for theming and structure of the theme object is very similar, we can combine them into one object:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import * as React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import {
  NavigationContainer,
  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,
} from &#x27;@react-navigation/native&#x27;;
import {
  DarkTheme as PaperDarkTheme,
  Provider as PaperProvider,
} from &#x27;react-native-paper&#x27;;

const CombinedDarkTheme = {
  ...PaperDarkTheme,
  ...NavigationDarkTheme,
  colors: { ...PaperDarkTheme.colors, ...NavigationDarkTheme.colors },
};

export default function Main() {
  return (
    &lt;PaperProvider theme={CombinedDarkTheme}&gt;
      &lt;NavigationContainer theme={CombinedDarkTheme}&gt;
        {/* content */}
      &lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
    &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>If code for themes merging looks complex, you can use a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge">deepmerge</a> package. It will simplify the implementation significantly.</p><h4>Custom themes</h4><p>Of course, the built-in themes are not the only themes we can apply. Both libraries allow full customization and you can learn about it in the official documentation (<a href="/docs/themes">React Navigation</a>, <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html">React Native Paper</a>)</p><p>In the last step, I want to show you how to change the theme dynamically. We will implement a switch in a drawer that will allow users choosing light or dark theme.</p><p>We need to store information about the currently selected theme somewhere. The local state of the root component sounds reasonable. Also, we will conditionally pass different themes based on the state.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import * as React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import {
  NavigationContainer,
  DefaultTheme as NavigationDefaultTheme,
  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,
} from &#x27;@react-navigation/native&#x27;;
import {
  DarkTheme as PaperDarkTheme,
  DefaultTheme as PaperDefaultTheme,
  Provider as PaperProvider,
} from &#x27;react-native-paper&#x27;;

const CombinedDefaultTheme = {
  ...PaperDefaultTheme,
  ...NavigationDefaultTheme,
};
const CombinedDarkTheme = { ...PaperDarkTheme, ...NavigationDarkTheme };

export default function Main() {
  const [isDarkTheme, setIsDarkTheme] = React.useState(false);

  const theme = isDarkTheme ? CombinedDarkTheme : CombinedDefaultTheme; // Use Light/Dark theme based on a state

  function toggleTheme() {
    // We will pass this function to Drawer and invoke it on theme switch press
    setIsDarkTheme(isDark =&gt; !isDark);
  }

  return (
    &lt;PaperProvider theme={theme}&gt;
      &lt;NavigationContainer theme={theme}&gt;{/* content */}&lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
    &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>As you remember, we already render a Switch in a Drawer, but we haven&#x27;t implemented any logic when it is pressed. Let&#x27;s take care of it now:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { View } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;;
import { DrawerContentScrollView } from &#x27;@react-navigation/drawer&#x27;;
import {
  useTheme,
  Avatar,
  Drawer,
  Text,
  TouchableRipple,
  Switch,
} from &#x27;react-native-paper&#x27;;

export function DrawerContent(props) {
  const paperTheme = useTheme();

  return (
    &lt;DrawerContentScrollView {...props}&gt;
      /* {...other - content} */
      &lt;Drawer.Section title=&quot;Preferences&quot;&gt;
        &lt;TouchableRipple onPress={props.toggleTheme}&gt;
          &lt;View style={styles.preference}&gt;
            &lt;Text&gt;Dark Theme&lt;/Text&gt;
            &lt;View pointerEvents=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
              &lt;Switch value={theme.dark} /&gt;
            &lt;/View&gt;
          &lt;/View&gt;
        &lt;/TouchableRipple&gt;
      &lt;/Drawer.Section&gt;
    &lt;/DrawerContentScrollView&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre><p>Firstly, we get a current theme using <code>useTheme</code> hook from Paper. This means we can check <code>dark</code> property on it and pass the correct value to <code>Switch</code>.</p><br/>Secondly, we pass a `toggleTheme` function to `TouchableRipple` to toggle theme whenever user presses a Switch. <p>You should be able to toggle a switch now and both <code>Provider</code> from Paper and <code>NativeNavigationContainer</code> from React Navigation will automatically apply correct colors to the components.</p><br/><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-paper/theming.gif" height="480"/><h2>Summary</h2><p>We all know that UI Component library like Paper can speed up the development, but integrating it with a navigation can be sometimes not very straighforward. I hope I showed you the most important aspects of this process in this guide. After reading this article, using Paper&#x27;s BottomNavigation, Appbar, Drawer, FAB or Portal alongside with React Navigation shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you.</p><p>Do you have any questions?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a guest post by the <a href="http://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten">UI Kitten</a> team. If you like this guide, checkout UI Kitten for more!
In this blog post, we&#x27;ll show a step-by-step guide on using React Navigation 5 with UI Kitten.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The new React Navigation comes with several significant improvements such as <a href="https://blog.expo.io/re-writing-react-navigation-stack-db6a376522b1">improving animation performance</a> with <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler">gesture-handler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated">reanimated</a> libraries. What&#x27;s more, it was migrated to TypeScript for improving the quality of your code base with type checking and more. But the biggest update is migrating to component-based API.</p><p><a href="https://eva.design">Eva Design System</a> is a customizable Design System that is easy to adapt to your brand. It provides Mobile and Web component libraries and allows businesses to quickly create beautiful unique branding themes. The React Native realization of Eva Design System includes <a href="http://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten">UI Kitten</a>, React Native framework for building modern cross-platform mobile applications.</p><p>The UI Kitten team started actively using React Navigation alpha and we&#x27;re proud to announce the full compatibility to the new React Navigation API. In this guide, we won&#x27;t consider how to implement all of the boilerplate stuff like auth screens. Instead, we will learn how to navigate between screens using Drawer, Bottom Tabs, Top Tabs, and Stack navigators to build a TODO-App. Furthermore, we&#x27;ll demonstrate using React Navigation with UI Kitten components.</p><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-ui-kitten/overview.gif" height="480"/><h2>Overview</h2><p>React Navigation 5 is nothing else rather than simplifying navigation structure in your app.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const AuthNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name=&#x27;Sign In&#x27; component={SignInScreen}/&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name=&#x27;Sign Up&#x27; component={SignUpScreen}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>To create a navigator, you import <code>createXNavigator</code> function from the navigator package of your choice and use <code>Navigator</code> and <code>Screen</code> components from the value it returns.</p><p>Unlike the previous React Navigation versions, all the screens used inside a navigator are passed as child elements with wrapping it to a <code>Screen</code> component. If you need to set up additional navigator configuration like configuration of the header, you can simply pass corresponding props directly to the <code>Navigator</code> component.</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>Clone the project from GitHub. It contains all the required source code for the initial setup.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo
</code></pre><h3>Step 1. Authentication flow</h3><p>Assuming that your app users will need to authorize before getting to the home screen, we will need to create both Authentication and Home navigators. Then we&#x27;re going to combine it with simple stack navigation and pick the initial screen depending on the user authorization status.</p><p>Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/auth.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/auth.navigator.tsx`</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;
import { SignInScreen, SignUpScreen, ResetPasswordScreen } from &#x27;../scenes/auth&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const AuthNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.SIGN_IN} component={SignInScreen}/&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.SIGN_UP} component={SignUpScreen}/&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.RESET_PASSWORD} component={ResetPasswordScreen}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>In this example, we&#x27;re using a <code>createStackNavigator</code> function to create simple stack navigation between Sign In, Sign Up and Reset Password screens. Under <code>Stack Navigator</code> we mean the default navigation behavior between screens: with slide-from-right animation on iOS, and slide-in-top on Android.</p><p>In <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/app.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/app.navigator.tsx</a> file and replace the placeholder screen with Auth Navigator. This will make authentication screens to be the starter point of your app.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AuthNavigator } from &#x27;./auth.navigator&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const AppNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.AUTH} component={AuthNavigator}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-ui-kitten/stack-navigator.gif" height="420"/><h3>Step 2. Top tabs</h3><p>Say, our app has both in-progress and finished tasks. So, you should separate them to avoid a mess. Here you can make it with two tabs on the home screen. To do this, we need to have three screens: two for tabs and one master screen for navigation management between tabs. Unlike the Stack Navigator component, the Top Tabs <code>Navigator</code> has a special prop for the component to control navigation between tabs - <code>tabBar</code>. We will use it to configure the tab bar with UI Kitten components.</p><p>Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/todo.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/todo.navigator.tsx`</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createMaterialTopTabNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/material-top-tabs&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;
import { TodoTabBar, TodoInProgressScreen, TodoDoneScreen } from &#x27;../scenes/todo&#x27;;
import { DoneAllIcon, GridIcon } from &#x27;../assets/icons&#x27;;

const TopTab = createMaterialTopTabNavigator();

export const TodoNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;TopTab.Navigator tabBar={props =&gt; &lt;TodoTabBar {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
    &lt;TopTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.TODO_IN_PROGRESS}
      component={TodoInProgressScreen}
      options={{ title: &#x27;IN PROGRESS&#x27;, tabBarIcon: GridIcon }}
    /&gt;
    &lt;TopTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.TODO_DONE}
      component={TodoDoneScreen}
      options={{ title: &#x27;DONE&#x27;, tabBarIcon: DoneAllIcon }}
    /&gt;
  &lt;/TopTab.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>The code above will enable you to navigate with gestures between <code>In Progress</code> screen and <code>Done</code> screen, but not set up the Tab Bar. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/scenes/todo/todo-tab-bar.component.tsx">./src/scenes/todo/todo-tab-bar.component.tsx</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { TabBar, Tab, Divider, TabElement } from &#x27;@ui-kitten/components&#x27;;
import { SafeAreaLayout, SaveAreaInset, SafeAreaLayoutElement } from &#x27;../../components/safe-area-layout.component&#x27;;
import { Toolbar } from &#x27;../../components/toolbar.component&#x27;;

export const TodoTabBar = (props): SafeAreaLayoutElement =&gt; {

  const onTabSelect = (index: number): void =&gt; {
    const selectedTabRoute: string = props.state.routeNames[index];
    props.navigation.navigate(selectedTabRoute);
  };

  const createNavigationTabForRoute = (route): TabElement =&gt; {
    const { options } = props.descriptors[route.key];
    return (
      &lt;Tab
        key={route.key}
        title={options.title}
        icon={options.tabBarIcon}
      /&gt;
    );
  };

  return (
    &lt;SafeAreaLayout insets={SaveAreaInset.TOP}&gt;
      &lt;Toolbar title=&#x27;React Navigation Ex 🐱&#x27;/&gt;
      &lt;TabBar selectedIndex={props.state.index} onSelect={onTabSelect}&gt;
        {props.state.routes.map(createNavigationTabForRoute)}
      &lt;/TabBar&gt;
      &lt;Divider/&gt;
    &lt;/SafeAreaLayout&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><p>With the code above we render <code>TabBar</code> component with two tabs inside: one per each screen inside <code>TodoNavigator</code>. Then, we use the React Navigation state to pass <code>selectedIndex</code> and <code>onSelect</code> props to navigate between screens. So, when the user taps one of the tabs, the <code>TabBar</code> component calls <code>onTabSelect</code> function and this is the place where we need to navigate to the corresponding route.</p><p>Finally, open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/app.navigator.tsx">app.navigator.tsx</a> file and add the <code>TodoNavigator</code> as a Home screen. Now you&#x27;re able to navigate the home screen with todo tabs after sign in.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AuthNavigator } from &#x27;./auth.navigator&#x27;;
import { TodoNavigator } from &#x27;./todo.navigator&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const AppNavigator = (props): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator {...props} headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.AUTH} component={AuthNavigator}/&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.HOME} component={TodoNavigator}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-ui-kitten/material-top-tab-navigator.gif" height="480"/><h3>Step 3. Bottom tabs</h3><p>Sometimes you may want your app to contain tabs at the bottom. Here is the main semantic difference regarding the tabs at the top: while they should represent the content of the same type, the bottom tabs could be used to show any content of your application. This is where we&#x27;re going to use <code>createBottomTabNavigator</code> and <code>BottomNavigation</code>.</p><p>Let&#x27;s start by creating another navigator for the second tab. The first one will be used for Todo screens. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/profile.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/profile.navigator.tsx</a> file and paste the following code: </p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;
import { ProfileScreen } from &#x27;../scenes/profile&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const ProfileNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.PROFILE} component={ProfileScreen}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>This will add a simple stack navigator, just like we did it for authentication flow.</p><p>Now we need to somehow connect <code>TodoNavigator</code> with <code>ProfileNavigator</code> . The implementation is as simple as creating a navigator for top tabs. Thanks to React Navigation, we have totally the same API for this. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/home.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/home.navigator.tsx</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/bottom-tabs&#x27;;
import { TodoNavigator } from &#x27;./todo.navigator&#x27;;
import { ProfileNavigator } from &#x27;./profile.navigator&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;
import { HomeTabBar } from &#x27;../scenes/home&#x27;;
import { LayoutIcon, PersonIcon } from &#x27;../assets/icons&#x27;;

const BottomTab = createBottomTabNavigator();

export const HomeNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;BottomTab.Navigator tabBar={props =&gt; &lt;HomeTabBar {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
    &lt;BottomTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.TODO}
      component={TodoNavigator}
      options={{ title: &#x27;TODO&#x27;, tabBarIcon: LayoutIcon }}
    /&gt;
    &lt;BottomTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.PROFILE}
      component={ProfileNavigator}
      options={{ title: &#x27;PROFILE&#x27;, tabBarIcon: PersonIcon }}
    /&gt;
  &lt;/BottomTab.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>Just like in the case with tabs at the top, we also need to make a custom <code>tabBar</code>. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/scenes/home/home-tab-bar.component.tsx">./src/scenes/home/home-tab-bar.component.tsx</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { BottomNavigation, BottomNavigationTab, Divider, BottomNavigationTabElement } from &#x27;@ui-kitten/components&#x27;;
import { SafeAreaLayout, SafeAreaLayoutElement, SaveAreaInset } from &#x27;../../components/safe-area-layout.component&#x27;;

export const HomeTabBar = (props): SafeAreaLayoutElement =&gt; {

  const onSelect = (index: number): void =&gt; {
    const selectedTabRoute: string = props.state.routeNames[index];
    props.navigation.navigate(selectedTabRoute);
  };

  const createNavigationTabForRoute = (route): BottomNavigationTabElement =&gt; {
    const { options } = props.descriptors[route.key];
    return (
      &lt;BottomNavigationTab
        key={route.key}
        title={options.title}
        icon={options.tabBarIcon}
      /&gt;
    );
  };

  return (
    &lt;SafeAreaLayout insets={SaveAreaInset.BOTTOM}&gt;
      &lt;Divider/&gt;
      &lt;BottomNavigation
        appearance=&#x27;noIndicator&#x27;
        selectedIndex={props.state.index}
        onSelect={onSelect}&gt;
        {props.state.routes.map(createNavigationTabForRoute)}
      &lt;/BottomNavigation&gt;
    &lt;/SafeAreaLayout&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><p>Using the code above we render <code>BottomNavigation</code> component with two tabs inside: one per each screen inside <code>HomeNavigator</code>. We use the React Navigation state to pass <code>selectedIndex</code> and <code>onSelect</code> props to navigate between screens. So, when the user taps one of the tabs, the <code>BottomNavigation</code> component calls <code>onSelect</code> function. Well, this is the place where we need to navigate to the corresponding route.</p><p>Then, open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/app.navigator.tsx">app.navigator.tsx</a> file and replace the <code>TodoNavigator</code> with <code>HomeNavigator</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createStackNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AuthNavigator } from &#x27;./auth.navigator&#x27;;
import { HomeNavigator } from &#x27;./home.navigator&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export const AppNavigator = (props): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Stack.Navigator {...props} headerMode=&#x27;none&#x27;&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.AUTH} component={AuthNavigator}/&gt;
    &lt;Stack.Screen name={AppRoute.HOME} component={HomeNavigator}/&gt;
  &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-ui-kitten/bottom-tab-navigator.gif" height="480"/><h3>Step 4. Drawer menu</h3><p>At the final stage of this guide, we will describe how to create the drawer navigation. While the top and bottom tabs can be used to present the main product features, a drawer menu can be also used to direct a user to legal information about it, or simply contain quick actions like a logout.</p><p>Usually, the drawer menu is available in app on the home screen, so let&#x27;s add it to <code>HomeNavigator</code>. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/home.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/home.navigator.tsx</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { createDrawerNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/drawer&#x27;;
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from &#x27;@react-navigation/bottom-tabs&#x27;;
import { TodoNavigator } from &#x27;./todo.navigator&#x27;;
import { ProfileNavigator } from &#x27;./profile.navigator&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;
import { HomeTabBar, HomeDrawer, AboutScreen } from &#x27;../scenes/home&#x27;;
import { HomeIcon, InfoIcon, LayoutIcon, PersonIcon } from &#x27;../assets/icons&#x27;;

const Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();
const BottomTab = createBottomTabNavigator();

const HomeBottomNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;BottomTab.Navigator tabBar={props =&gt; &lt;HomeTabBar {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
    &lt;BottomTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.TODO}
      component={TodoNavigator}
      options={{ title: &#x27;TODO&#x27;, tabBarIcon: LayoutIcon }}
    /&gt;
    &lt;BottomTab.Screen
      name={AppRoute.PROFILE}
      component={ProfileNavigator}
      options={{ title: &#x27;PROFILE&#x27;, tabBarIcon: PersonIcon }}
    /&gt;
  &lt;/BottomTab.Navigator&gt;
);

export const HomeNavigator = (): React.ReactElement =&gt; (
  &lt;Drawer.Navigator drawerContent={props =&gt; &lt;HomeDrawer {...props} /&gt;}&gt;
    &lt;Drawer.Screen
      name={AppRoute.HOME}
      component={HomeBottomNavigator}
      options={{ title: &#x27;Home&#x27;, drawerIcon: HomeIcon }}
    /&gt;
    &lt;Drawer.Screen
      name={AppRoute.ABOUT}
      component={AboutScreen}
      options={{ title: &#x27;About&#x27;, drawerIcon: InfoIcon }}
    /&gt;
  &lt;/Drawer.Navigator&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>In this example, we&#x27;ve implemented a Drawer Navigator with <code>createDrawerNavigator</code> and used it to display on the Home screen. We have also added <code>AboutScreen</code> to demonstrate navigation directly from the Drawer menu.</p><p>Just like Top/Bottom tab navigators, the drawer navigator also has a special property for declaring custom drawer view. Use a <code>drawerContent</code> property to pass the custom view to the navigator. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/scenes/home/home-drawer.component.tsx">./src/scenes/home/home-drawer.component.tsx</a> file and add the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { Drawer, DrawerItem, DrawerElement DrawerItemElement } from &#x27;@ui-kitten/components&#x27;;
import { SafeAreaLayout, SaveAreaInset } from &#x27;../../components/safe-area-layout.component&#x27;;

export const HomeDrawer = (props): DrawerElement =&gt; {

  const onItemSelect = (index: IndexPath): void =&gt; {
    const selectedTabRoute: string = props.state.routeNames[index.row];
    props.navigation.navigate(selectedTabRoute);
    props.navigation.closeDrawer();
  };

  const createDrawerItemForRoute = (route, index: number): DrawerItemElement =&gt; {
    const { options } = props.descriptors[route.key];
    return (
      &lt;DrawerItem
        key={index}
        title={route.name}
        accessoryLeft={options.drawerIcon}
      /&gt;
    );
  };

  return (
    &lt;SafeAreaLayout insets={SaveAreaInset.TOP}&gt;
      &lt;Drawer
        data={props.state.routes.map(createNavigationItemForRoute)}
        onSelect={onMenuItemSelect}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/SafeAreaLayout&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><p>Due to the use of this code, we render <code>Drawer</code> component with two actions inside: one for navigating to legal information screen and one for performing a user logout. Then, we pass <code>data</code> prop to display our actions and <code>onSelect</code> prop to handle it. So, when the user taps the action, the <code>Drawer</code> component calls <code>onMenuItemSelect</code> function and this is the place where we need to handle it.`</p><p>The next thing to do is to modify the Todo tab bar by adding a menu icon to open a drawer. Open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/scenes/todo/todo-tab-bar.component.tsx">./src/scenes/todo/todo-tab-bar.component.tsx</a> file and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { TabBar, Tab, Divider, TabElement } from &#x27;@ui-kitten/components&#x27;;
import { SafeAreaLayout, SaveAreaInset, SafeAreaLayoutElement } from &#x27;../../components/safe-area-layout.component&#x27;;
import { Toolbar } from &#x27;../../components/toolbar.component&#x27;;
import { MenuIcon } from &#x27;../../assets/icons&#x27;;

export const TodoTabBar = (props): SafeAreaLayoutElement =&gt; {

  const onTabSelect = (index: number): void =&gt; {
    const selectedTabRoute: string = props.state.routeNames[index];
    props.navigation.navigate(selectedTabRoute);
  };

  const createNavigationTabForRoute = (route): TabElement =&gt; {
    const { options } = props.descriptors[route.key];
    return (
      &lt;Tab
        key={route.key}
        title={options.title}
        icon={options.tabBarIcon}
      /&gt;
    );
  };

  return (
    &lt;SafeAreaLayout insets={SaveAreaInset.TOP}&gt;
      &lt;Toolbar
        title=&#x27;React Navigation Ex 🐱&#x27;
        backIcon={MenuIcon}
        onBackPress={props.navigation.toggleDrawer}
      /&gt;
      &lt;TabBar selectedIndex={props.state.index} onSelect={onTabSelect}&gt;
        {props.state.routes.map(createNavigationTabForRoute)}
      &lt;/TabBar&gt;
      &lt;Divider/&gt;
    &lt;/SafeAreaLayout&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><img src="/assets/blog/using-react-navigation-5-with-ui-kitten/drawer-navigator.gif" height="420"/><h3>TypeScript</h3><p>The new React Navigation has great TypeScript support and exports type definitions for navigators and custom navigation components. Sometimes you may want to type-check the params you&#x27;re passing when navigating between routes. You also may want to make autocomplete work when working with navigation props. </p><p>Let&#x27;s add some type definitions for Auth screens. For this purpose, open <a href="https://github.com/artyorsh/react-navigation-ex-demo/blob/complete-exmaples/src/navigation/auth.navigator.tsx">./src/navigation/auth.navigator.tsx</a> and paste the following code:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import { RouteProp } from &#x27;@react-navigation/core&#x27;;
import { StackNavigationProp } from &#x27;@react-navigation/stack&#x27;;
import { AppRoute } from &#x27;./app-routes&#x27;;

type AuthNavigatorParams = {
  [AppRoute.SIGN_IN]: undefined;
  [AppRoute.SIGN_UP]: undefined;
  [AppRoute.RESET_PASSWORD]: undefined;
}

export interface SignInScreenProps {
  navigation: StackNavigationProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.SIGN_IN&gt;;
  route: RouteProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.SIGN_IN&gt;;
}

export interface SignUpScreenProps {
  navigation: StackNavigationProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.SIGN_UP&gt;;
  route: RouteProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.SIGN_UP&gt;;
}

export interface ResetPasswordScreenProps {
  navigation: StackNavigationProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.RESET_PASSWORD&gt;;
  route: RouteProp&lt;AuthNavigatorParams, AppRoute.RESET_PASSWORD&gt;;
}
</code></pre><p>Now you can modify props of Auth screens props by adding types to make your autocomplete and IntelliSense work.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>React Navigation steps firmly into the next level and we’re very excited to announce to you something great happening in React Navigation codebase.</p><h2>Make it custom</h2><p>From the very beginning of React Navigation we have been following the important motto to make navigation experience customizable in every detail. We, front-end engineers, mobile developers and User Experience lovers, have a deep need to make decisions about each layout component.</p><p>Guided by this idea we (well, not necessarily “we” because I haven’t even written a single line of code this time 😄) made architectural decisions, which might appear controversial for developers with the native background.</p><p>We have decided to write React Navigation only in JavaScript replicating native animations and interactions. This is the main decision making our solution very different from other React Native navigation libraries (like <a href="https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation">React Native Navigation</a> by Wix or <a href="https://grahammendick.github.io/navigation/">The Navigation Router</a> by Graham Mendick).</p><p>But… why? What’s the purpose of reinventing the wheel?</p><p>Firstly, because JavaScript implementation can be more customizable. It’s easy to maintain and develop new features. Additionally, being independent of native code makes our codebase more reliable.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s easy not only for maintainers but also for developers using our library. No need for native setup makes it super simple to start developing and integrating with the existing (e.g. brownfield) app. Eventually, a very wide range of customizations makes it a great solution for developers with very high UX requirements.</p><p>The above reasons have made React Navigation navigation super popular among a number of developers but…</p><p>After years of growing development, we need to admit that we’re not always able to deliver an exactly native-like experience, especially when it comes to stack navigation. We also see a ton of users that use just a few ways of customization React Navigation offers…</p><h2><strong>Native reveal</strong></h2><p>…so, we have decided to export native stack (<em>FragmentTransaction </em>on Android and <em>UINavigationController </em>on iOS) in order to deliver an even better experience.</p><p>Thanks to the great work of Krzysztof Magiera for <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens">React Native Screens</a> library now we can use truly native components instead of JS replicas.</p><img src="/assets/blog/android-native-stack.gif" height="530"/><img src="/assets/blog/ios-native-stack.gif" height="530"/><p>We believe you will find it useful in your projects and strongly encourage you to get acquainted with our <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens/native-stack">documentation</a>. Things that I’m the most excited about are iOS header animations!</p><p>Please, note that we don’t intend this component to be a drop-off replacement for the currently existing stack. There are many benefits of using JavaScript-based stack. Moreover, the range of customization of the native stack is very limited and probably won’t get broader due to the limitations of native API.</p><p>Native Stack is available in the new 5.0 alpha API and with <a href="https://github.com/satya164">Satyajit</a>’s help, I have managed to release the first version of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-navigation/native-stack">library</a> a few days ago. It’s in alpha so don’t expect everything to be perfect, but… don’t hesitate to submit a <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pulls">PR</a> and help us grow React Navigation!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The documentation is now live at <a href="https://reactnavigation.org">https://reactnavigation.org</a>, and v3 lives <a href="/docs/3.x/getting-started">here</a>.</p><p>In this release, we have removed the navigators from the react-navigation package. The navigators have lived in separate packages for quite a while and you could already use those packages manually, but we still bundled them in the react-navigation package. This made it difficult for us to release significant updates to navigators, because we had to then do a major version release of react-navigation too. By separating the navigator packages there is more freedom to update and improve navigators without any impact on folks that don&#x27;t use them.</p><p>For example, you will find when you install the latest versions of the drawer and tab navigators that the animations are more performant because they use react-native-reanimated to smoothly animate gestures. These have been available in react-navigation-drawer and react-navigation-tabs for several months now but we delayed updating them in react-navigation itself because we did not want to force every user to update.</p><p>With this version, you now install the navigators from their respective packages, which means that you can independently update them.</p><p>The navigators live at:</p><ul><li><code>createStackNavigator</code> - <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/stack"><code>react-navigation-stack</code></a></li><li><code>createBottomTabNavigator</code>, <code>createMaterialTopTabNavigator</code> - <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/tabs"><code>react-navigation-tabs</code></a></li><li><code>createDrawerNavigator</code> - <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/drawer"><code>react-navigation-drawer</code></a></li></ul><p>For upgrade instructions, please check the <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/v4.0.0">release notes</a>.</p><p>If you&#x27;re using TypeScript, navigator specific types were also removed from the main package. We&#x27;ve mentioned the replacement types in the release notes. But if you are still having problems, please open an issue and let us know.</p><hr/><p>Thanks for reading, please post any issues you encounter to <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The documentation is now live at <a href="https://reactnavigation.org">https://reactnavigation.org</a>, and v2 lives <a href="/docs/2.x/getting-started">here</a>.</p><p>This is the first release where React Navigation depends on a native module outside of React Native core: it now depends on react-native-gesture-handler. This library provides an excellent set of primitives for leveraging the operating systems’ native gesture APIs and has enabled us to fix a variety of issues with stack and drawer navigators. React Navigation also depends on react-native-screens, but you don’t need to install the native module if you prefer not to use it (we have a blog post coming soon that will explain what react-native-screens is and why you may want to use it, or you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Jl1KCWiag">this talk</a> by the author of the library).</p><p>We didn’t get around to every feature that we wanted to land for this release, but we also didn’t want to hold it up further because we expect that you will want to start using it right away - the release includes performance improvements, bugfixes, ergonomics improvements, some handy new features, and a re-organizing of the internals to improve support for web as a target of React Navigation.</p><p>Let’s get started with react-navigation 3.0.</p><h1>Installation</h1><p>First, install the library using your favorite package manager: <code>yarn add react-navigation@^3.0.0</code></p><p>Next, install react-native-gesture-handler. If you’re using Expo you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in the SDK. Otherwise, follow <a href="https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html#installation">these installation instructions</a>.</p><p>Optionally, you can install react-native-screens. If you’re using Expo you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in SDK 30 and higher. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the README on <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens">https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: if you have manually installed any navigators in your project, for example react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs, you will need to update those to a version that is compatible with 3.0.0. In the case of react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs, 1.0.0 is compatible.</p></blockquote><h1>Breaking changes</h1><p>When you first run your app after updating it won’t work because react-navigation@^3 requires you to add an app container to the root navigator. Once you get that in place, you may notice that your navigation options aren’t being applied as you expect - this is due to navigationOptions in navigator configuration being renamed to defaultNavigationOptions. If you use a drawer, you may notice that it feels quicker, but if you depend on inactive screens being unmounted you’ll be surprised. More details on these changes and how to update your app to work just as well (probably better) than before below.</p><h2>Explicit app container required for the root navigator</h2><p>In the past, any navigator could act as the navigation container at the top-level of your app because they were all wrapped in “navigation containers”. The navigation container, now known as an app container, is a higher-order-component that maintains the navigation state of your app and handles interacting with the outside world to turn linking events into navigation actions and so on.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import {
  createStackNavigator,
  createAppContainer
} from &#x27;react-navigation&#x27;;
const MainNavigator = createStackNavigator({...});
const App = createAppContainer(MainNavigator);
</code></pre><p>This should be an easy change - import <code>createAppContainer</code> in the root of your app and use it to wrap the root navigator.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: if you have any custom navigators, you may have used <code>createNavigationContainer</code>, you can remove this now because it’s only used at the root of the app and provided by the user.</p></blockquote><h2>Renamed navigationOptions in navigator configuration</h2><p>When configuring navigators it’s often useful to pass in default navigation options for the screens inside of that navigator. For example in a stack you might want to set a background color and tint color for each screen. Previously, you would write something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Feed: ExampleScreen,
    Profile: ExampleScreen,
  },
  {
    navigationOptions: {
      headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
      headerStyle: {
        backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
      },
    },
  }
);
</code></pre><p>As of this release, <code>navigationOptions</code> in navigator configuration like this has been renamed to <code>defaultNavigationOptions</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Feed: ExampleScreen,
    Profile: ExampleScreen,
  },
  {
    defaultNavigationOptions: {
      headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
      headerStyle: {
        backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
      },
    },
  }
);
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you need to configure the <code>navigationOptions</code> for a navigator itself. Typically you’d do something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-js">Home.navigationOptions = { tabBarLabel: &#x27;Home!&#x27; };
</code></pre><p>As of this release, you can use <code>navigationOptions</code> in the navigator config for this instead.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Feed: ExampleScreen,
    Profile: ExampleScreen,
  },
  {
    defaultNavigationOptions: {
      headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
      headerStyle: {
        backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
      },
    },
    navigationOptions: {
      tabBarLabel: &#x27;Home!&#x27;,
    },
  }
);

const Tabs = createBottomTabNavigator({ Home });
</code></pre><p><a href="https://snack.expo.io/@notbrent/belligerent-pizza">See this example on Snack</a>.</p><p>We’re sorry to make you go hunt through your code and rename a handful of strings, the hope is that this change makes the code more readable and more intuitive to new users in the future.</p><h2>Drawer now keeps inactive tabs in memory by default</h2><p>Previously when using the drawer navigator screens would unmount when inactive, and when you switch back to them you’d need to re-render the entire thing. In tabs these stay in memory as you would expect, so once you switch to the screen once it’s faster to go back there again and you don’t lose your place in a scroll view or anything. Drawer now behaves the same way, but you can go back to the old behavior if you like by passing in <code>unmountInactiveRoutes: true</code> in the drawer navigation configuration.</p><h2>Default stack background color is now white</h2><p>You can customize this by using <code>cardStyle</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-js">createStackNavigator(routes, { cardStyle: { backgroundColor: &#x27;#ccc&#x27; } });
</code></pre><h1>New features</h1><ul><li>react-navigation now exports <code>ScrollView</code>, <code>FlatList</code>, and <code>SectionList</code> that will scroll to top when tapping on the active tab as you would expect from native tab bars.</li><li>Drawer supports two more types in addition to the default ‘front’ behavior that you expect from typical Android drawers: back and slide.</li><li>You can now provide default params inside of route definitions:</li></ul><pre><code class="language-js">const Store = createStackNavigator({
  Playstation: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: &#x27;Playstation&#x27; } },
  Xbox: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: &#x27;Xbox&#x27; } },
});
</code></pre><ul><li>Basic support for hooks in <code>react-navigation-hooks</code> (although this isn&#x27;t too useful yet without a stable react-native build that supports hooks, you can play with it on the web!).</li><li><code>headerBackgroundTransitionPreset: &#x27;toggle&#x27; | &#x27;fade&#x27; | &#x27;translate&#x27;</code> lets you choose how to transition your custom <code>headerBackground</code> components between screens.</li><li>Add options to opt in/out of the stack card overlay and shadow that are visible during transitions: <code>cardShadowEnabled</code> defaults to <code>true</code> and <code>cardOverlayEnabled</code> defaults to <code>false</code>.</li><li>Export <code>StackGestureContext</code> and <code>DrawerGestureContext</code> from react-navigation-stack and react-navigation-drawer, so you can use the ref from the corresponding gestures with other gesture handlers (eg: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-drawer/blob/bf4bdba7f6a4fbc12192f5d5ba2285f6280431b7/example/src/GestureInteraction.js">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-drawer/blob/bf4bdba7f6a4fbc12192f5d5ba2285f6280431b7/example/src/GestureInteraction.js</a>).</li><li>Tab navigators support <code>tabBarOnLongPress</code> configuration option, which defaults to the same as the tab press event.</li></ul><h1>Assorted fixes &amp; improvements</h1><ul><li>Stack transition performance improved greatly by removing the shadow from the entire card and rendering it only on the slice where it is needed. The card opacity is also no longer directly animated but instead an overlay is put on top to create a similar effect but with better performance.</li><li>Fix long-standing issues with stack that led to quietly re-mounting screens when navigating quickly in certain patterns: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4155">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4155</a></li><li>Support inverted gesture in modals.</li><li>Stack card gesture uses react-native-gesture-handler and native driver so the gesture runs on the UI thread (except when the gesture ends, then it calls back to JS).</li><li>Fix a variety of issues with drawer navigator, including issues around nesting (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4154">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4154</a>) and bugs with firing open / close (eg: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5146">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5146</a>).</li><li>Fix accessibility voiceover for tabs and stack back button.</li></ul><h1>Ecosystem and web support</h1><p>React Navigation 3.0 brings some important changes to the React Navigation ecosystem: the project now lives across a number of repositories and packages, we have an exciting new transitioner on the way, and the core finally has first-class support for web apps on the client and server!</p><h2>Independent Projects</h2><p>React Navigation has always been a set of loosely-coupled navigation components: Stack, Tabs, Drawer, etc. But until now they have always lived in the main navigation repo, which has been difficult to maintain. People often struggle to use different versions of these components, or they want to fork them for their own app.</p><p>In v3, all of our main packages and repos are separated. There are the following core packages in our new NPM org:</p><ul><li><code>@react-navigation/core</code> - The primitives and utilities that define our patterns, plus several routers</li><li><code>@react-navigation/native</code> - Container and support for navigators on React Native apps. <code>createAppContainer</code> from the main <code>react-navigation</code> package actually comes from this package.</li><li><code>@react-navigation/web</code> - Web browser app container, and utilities for server rendering</li></ul><p>In addition, we have published our community-maintained components as standalone repos and packages:</p><ul><li><code>react-navigation-stack</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-tabs</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-drawer</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-transitioner</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-hooks</code></li></ul><p>To keep the experience as simple as possible the <code>react-navigation</code> package will continue to be supported, and will contain most of the above components as it did before.</p><h2>Web Support</h2><p>Now that the core of React Navigation can be used outside of React Native, we can provide first-class web support to anyone using React.js on the web, including those who do not want to use <code>react-native-web</code>.</p><p>Here is an example web app which demonstrates the new <code>createBrowserApp</code> container and the built-in <code>Link</code> component:</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">import { createSwitchNavigator } from &quot;@react-navigation/core&quot;;
import { createBrowserApp, Link } from &quot;@react-navigation/web&quot;;

class Home extends React.Component {
  static path = &quot;&quot;;
  static navigationOptions = {
    title: &quot;Home&quot;,
  };
  render () {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Home Screen&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;Link toRoute=&quot;Profile&quot; params={{ name: &quot;Brent&quot;, view: &quot;photos&quot; }}&gt;
          Brent&#x27;s photos
        &lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
class Profile extends React.Component {
  static path = &quot;/profile/:name&quot;;
  ...
}

const AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({
  Home,
  Profile,
});

const App = createBrowserApp(AppNavigator);

export default App;
</code></pre><p>The above <code>Link</code> tag will render to:

            <description><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the release candidate of version 3.0 today!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the release candidate of version 3.0 today!</p><p>This is the first release where React Navigation depends on a native module outside of React Native core: it now depends on react-native-gesture-handler. This library provides an excellent set of primitives for leveraging the operating systems’ native gesture APIs and has enabled us to fix a variety of issues with stack and drawer navigators. React Navigation also depends on react-native-screens, but you don’t need to install the native module if you prefer not to use it (we have a blog post coming soon that will explain what react-native-screens is and why you may want to use it, or you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Jl1KCWiag">this talk</a> by the author of the library).</p><p>We didn’t get around to every feature that we wanted to land for this release, but we also didn’t want to hold it up further because we expect that you will want to start using it right away - the release includes performance improvements, bugfixes, ergonomics improvements, some handy new features, and a re-organizing of the internals to improve support for web as a target of React Navigation.</p><p>Let’s get started with react-navigation 3.0.</p><h1>Installation</h1><p>First, install the library using your favorite package manager: <code>yarn add react-navigation@^3.0.0-rc.0</code></p><p>Next, install react-native-gesture-handler. If you’re using Expo you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in the SDK. Otherwise: <code>yarn add react-native-gesture-handler &amp;&amp; react-native link</code></p><p>Optionally, you can install react-native-screens. If you’re using Expo you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in SDK 30 and higher. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the README on <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens">https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: if you have manually installed any navigators in your project, for example react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs, you will need to update those to a version that is compatible with 3.0.0. In the case of react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs, 1.0.0-alpha.2 is compatible.</p></blockquote><h1>Breaking changes</h1><p>When you first run your app after updating it won’t work because react-navigation@^3 requires you to add an app container to the root navigator. Once you get that in place, you may notice that your navigation options aren’t being applied as you expect - this is due to navigationOptions in navigator configuration being renamed to defaultNavigationOptions. If you use a drawer, you may notice that it feels quicker, but if you depend on inactive screens being unmounted you’ll be surprised. More details on these changes and how to update your app to work just as well (probably better) than before below.</p><h2>Explicit app container required for the root navigator</h2><p>In the past, any navigator could act as the navigation container at the top-level of your app because they were all wrapped in “navigation containers”. The navigation container, now known as an app container, is a higher-order-component that maintains the navigation state of your app and handles interacting with the outside world to turn linking events into navigation actions and so on.</p><pre><code class="language-js">import {
  createStackNavigator,
  createAppContainer
} from &#x27;react-navigation&#x27;;
const MainNavigator = createStackNavigator({...});
const App = createAppContainer(MainNavigator);
</code></pre><p>This should be an easy change - import <code>createAppContainer</code> in the root of your app and use it to wrap the root navigator.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: if you have any custom navigators, you may have used  <code>createNavigationContainer</code>, you can remove this now because it’s only used at the root of the app and provided by the user.</p></blockquote><h2>Renamed navigationOptions in navigator configuration</h2><p>When configuring navigators it’s often useful to pass in default navigation options for the screens inside of that navigator. For example in a stack you might want to set a background color and tint color for each screen. Previously, you would write something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator({
  Feed: ExampleScreen,
  Profile: ExampleScreen,
}, {
  navigationOptions: {
    headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
    },
  }
});
</code></pre><p>As of this release, <code>navigationOptions</code> in navigator configuration like this has been renamed to <code>defaultNavigationOptions</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator({
  Feed: ExampleScreen,
  Profile: ExampleScreen,
}, {
  defaultNavigationOptions: {
    headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
    },
  },
});
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you need to configure the <code>navigationOptions</code> for a navigator itself. Typically you’d do something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-js">Home.navigationOptions = { tabBarLabel: &#x27;Home!&#x27; };
</code></pre><p>As of this release, you can use <code>navigationOptions</code> in the navigator config for this instead.</p><pre><code class="language-js">const Home = createStackNavigator({
  Feed: ExampleScreen,
  Profile: ExampleScreen,
}, {
  defaultNavigationOptions: {
    headerTintColor: &#x27;#fff&#x27;,
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: &#x27;#000&#x27;,
    },
  },
  navigationOptions: {
    tabBarLabel: &#x27;Home!&#x27;,
  },
});

const Tabs = createBottomTabNavigator({ Home });
</code></pre><p><a href="https://snack.expo.io/@notbrent/belligerent-pizza">See this example on Snack</a>.</p><p>We’re sorry to make you go hunt through your code and rename a handful of strings, the hope is that this change makes the code more readable and more intuitive to new users in the future.</p><h2>Drawer now keeps inactive tabs in memory by default</h2><p>Previously when using the drawer navigator screens would unmount when inactive, and when you switch back to them you’d need to re-render the entire thing. In tabs these stay in memory as you would expect, so once you switch to the screen once it’s faster to go back there again and you don’t lose your place in a scroll view or anything. Drawer now behaves the same way, but you can go back to the old behavior if you like by passing in <code>unmountInactiveRoutes: true</code> in the drawer navigation configuration.</p><h1>New features</h1><ul><li>react-navigation now exports <code>ScrollView</code>, <code>FlatList</code>, and <code>SectionList</code> that will scroll to top when tapping on the active tab as you would expect from native tab bars.</li><li>Drawer supports two more types in addition to the default ‘front’ behavior that you expect from typical Android drawers: back and slide.</li><li>You can now provide default params inside of route definitions:</li></ul><pre><code class="language-js">const Store = createStackNavigator({
  Playstation: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: &#x27;Playstation&#x27; } },
  Xbox: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: &#x27;Xbox&#x27; } },
});
</code></pre><ul><li>Basic support for hooks in <code>react-navigation-hooks</code></li><li><code>headerBackgroundTransitionPreset: &#x27;toggle&#x27; | &#x27;fade&#x27; | &#x27;translate&#x27;</code> lets you choose how to transition your custom <code>headerBackground</code> components between screens.</li><li>Add options to opt in/out of the stack card overlay and shadow that are visible during transitions: <code>cardShadowEnabled</code> defaults to <code>true</code> and  <code>cardOverlayEnabled</code> defaults to <code>false</code>.</li><li>Export <code>StackGestureContext</code> and <code>DrawerGestureContext</code> from react-navigation-stack and react-navigation-drawer, so you can use the ref from the corresponding gestures with other gesture handlers (eg: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-drawer/blob/bf4bdba7f6a4fbc12192f5d5ba2285f6280431b7/example/src/GestureInteraction.js">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-drawer/blob/bf4bdba7f6a4fbc12192f5d5ba2285f6280431b7/example/src/GestureInteraction.js</a>).</li></ul><h1>Assorted fixes &amp; improvements</h1><ul><li>Stack transition performance improved greatly by removing the shadow from the entire card and rendering it only on the slice where it is needed. The card opacity is also no longer directly animated but instead an overlay is put on top to create a similar effect but with better performance.</li><li>Fix long-standing issues with stack that led to quietly re-mounting screens when navigating quickly in certain patterns: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4155">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4155</a></li><li>Support inverted gesture in modals.</li><li>Stack card gesture uses react-native-gesture-handler and native driver so the gesture runs on the UI thread (except when the gesture ends, then it calls back to JS).</li><li>Fix a variety of issues with drawer navigator, including issues around nesting (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4154">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4154</a>) and bugs with firing open / close (eg: <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5146">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/5146</a>).</li></ul><h1>Ecosystem and web support</h1><p>React Navigation 3.0 brings some important changes to the React Navigation ecosystem: the project now lives across a number of repositories and packages, we have an exciting new transitioner on the way, and the core finally has first-class support for web apps on the client and server!</p><h2>Independent Projects</h2><p>React Navigation has always been a set of loosely-coupled navigation components: Stack, Tabs, Drawer, etc. But until now they have always lived in the main navigation repo, which has been difficult to maintain. People often struggle to use different versions of these components, or they want to fork them for their own app.</p><p>In v3, all of our main packages and repos are separated. There are the following core packages in our new NPM org:</p><ul><li><code>@react-navigation/core</code> - The primitives and utilities that define our patterns, plus several routers</li><li><code>@react-navigation/native</code> - Container and support for navigators on React Native apps. <code>createAppContainer</code> from the main <code>react-navigation</code> package actually comes from this package.</li><li><code>@react-navigation/web</code> - Web browser app container, and utilities for server rendering</li></ul><p>In addition, we have published our community-maintained components as standalone repos and packages:</p><ul><li><code>react-navigation-stack</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-tabs</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-drawer</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-transitioner</code></li><li><code>react-navigation-hooks</code></li></ul><p>To keep the experience as simple as possible the <code>react-navigation</code> package will continue to be supported, and will contain most of the above components as it did before.</p><h2>Web Support</h2><p>Now that the core of React Navigation can be used outside of React Native, we can provide first-class web support to anyone using React.js on the web, including those who do not want to use <code>react-native-web</code>.</p><p>Here is an example web app which demonstrates the new <code>createBrowserApp</code> container and the built-in  <code>Link</code> component:</p><pre><code class="language-js">import { createSwitchNavigator } from &quot;@react-navigation/core&quot;;
import { createBrowserApp, Link } from &quot;@react-navigation/web&quot;;

class Home extends React.Component {
  static path = &quot;&quot;;
  static navigationOptions = {
    title: &quot;Home&quot;,
  };
  render () {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Home Screen&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;Link toRoute=&quot;Profile&quot; params={{ name: &quot;Brent&quot;, view: &quot;photos&quot; }}&gt;
          Brent&#x27;s photos
        &lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
class Profile extends React.Component {
  static path = &quot;/profile/:name&quot;;
  ...
}

const AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({
  Home,
  Profile,
});

const App = createBrowserApp(AppNavigator);

export default App;
</code></pre><p>The above <code>Link</code> tag will render to:
<code>&lt;a href=``&quot;``/profile/Brent?view=photos``&quot;``&gt;Brent&#x27;s Photos&lt;/a&gt;</code></p><p>See a simple web app with Create React App <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/example-web">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The documentation is now live at <a href="https://reactnavigation.org">https://reactnavigation.org</a>, and v1 lives <a href="/docs/1.x/getting-started">here</a>.</p><h2>Significant breaking changes</h2><p>The following changes are considered “significant” because they can’t be fixed by search and replace or something that is similarly mechanical.</p><h3><code>navigate(routeName)</code> in StackNavigator is “less pushy”</h3><p>In 1.x, <code>navigate(routeName)</code> and <code>push(routeName)</code> were very similar: every time you called <code>navigate(routeName)</code> it would push a new route to the stack. Now <code>navigate(routeName)</code> will first try to find an existing instance of the route and jump to that if it exists, otherwise it will push the route to the stack.</p><p>To update your app for this change you may need to change <code>navigate</code> to <code>push</code> in places where you would like to push a new route every time. Alternatively, you could consider using a <code>key</code>: <code>navigate({routeName: ‘MyRoute’, key: data.uniqueId, params: data})</code>. <a href="/docs/2.x/navigation-key">Read more about navigation with keys</a>.</p><p>Read more about this in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0004-less-pushy-navigate.md">RFC 4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/7a978b1087ff3acc7dd71267bd900d15c932d7cc">commit 7a978b1</a>.</p><h3><code>push</code> now propagates between routers like <code>navigate</code></h3><p>Previously, <code>push</code> only applied to the deepest active stack router. This meant that if you had Stack A &gt; Stack B and Stack B fired <code>push(‘MyRoute’)</code>, even if Stack B does not have a route with the name <code>’MyRoute’</code> and Stack A does, the screen would not be pushed. We made this change to accommodate for the “less pushy” navigate behavior.</p><p>When updating your app, you may want to double check where you use <code>push</code> to ensure that this doesn’t impact the expected behavior of your app.</p><p>Read about this in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0004-less-pushy-navigate.md#drawbacks">RFC 4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3617">pull 3617</a>.</p><h3>Shallow navigation options</h3><p>A common source of confusion for developers working with React Navigation has been around <code>navigationOptions</code> resolution. For example, if you have a stack navigator with a header, and a drawer inside of that stack, then in some circumstances the title of the stack would change every time you change screens in the drawer. This is because the stack navigator would crawl into child navigators and pull <code>navigationOptions</code> off of the deepest active screen. As of 2.0, this no longer happens: navigators will only look at their direct children for <code>navigationOptions</code>.</p><p>Read more about the justification for this in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0005-shallow-navigation-options.md">RFC 5</a>. Also see the new documentation page <a href="/docs/2.x/navigation-options-resolution">Navigation options resolution</a> to learn more.</p><h3>New API for creating navigators</h3><p>It is now easier to create and maintain custom navigators. The new <code>createNavigator</code> API fully decouples the navigation view from the router. Information about each screen is available on a single &quot;descriptor&quot;, including the pre-computed child navigation prop, allowing you to focus on custom navigation views.</p><p>Custom navigators can now provide actions helpers for their screens. For example, the new drawer navigator now allows <code>props.navigation.openDrawer()</code> within its screen components.</p><p>This does not impact most users - you won&#x27;t need to make any changes for this unless you use custom navigators in your app. Read more about the changes in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-navigator-view-api.md">RFC 2</a>. Also read the <a href="/docs/2.x/custom-navigators">custom navigators documentation</a>. You can also watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/wJJZ9Od8MjM?t=1215">&quot;Creating a navigator&quot; section in this talk</a> to learn more.</p><h2>Trivial breaking changes</h2><p>The following changes are considered “trivial” because you will only need make straightforward and mechanical changes to update your app for them.</p><h3>Drawer routes have been replaced with actions</h3><p>Rather than opening a drawer with <code>navigation.navigate(‘DrawerOpen’)</code>, you can now call <code>navigation.openDrawer()</code>. Other methods are <code>closeDrawer()</code> and <code>toggleDrawer()</code>.  See <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3618">pull 3618</a>.</p><h3>Navigation actions API overhaul</h3><p>In practice, this change is unlikely to impact your app at all except for one case that is mentioned below.</p><p>In 1.x, functions on the <code>navigation</code> were not contextual - they would be the same regardless of whether your screen was inside of a drawer, a stack, a tab navigator, etc. In 2.0 the functions that are available to you on the <code>navigation</code> prop depend on the navigators that it corresponds to. If your screen is inside of both a stack and a drawer navigator, you will have helpers for both -- <code>push</code> and <code>openDrawer</code>, for example.</p><p>Given that we only exposed generic helpers (<code>navigate</code>, <code>goBack</code>) and helpers specific to the stack in 1.x, this would only impact you if you attempted to use the stack helpers from outside of a stack. For example, if you had a tab navigator with a stack in tab A and just a plain screen in tab B, then tried to <code>push</code> a route from the screen in tab B, <code>push</code> would not be available. Keep this in mind when you update your app if it follows this type of structure.</p><p>One of the big improvements you get from this is that you can now add your own helpers to the <code>navigation</code> prop!  Read more in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0006-action-creators.md">RFC 6</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3392">pull 3392</a>.</p><h3>NavigationActions no longer have <code>toString()</code> implementations (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4072">related</a>)</h3><p>This change was intended to simplify the implementation of actions. We may go back on this, however, and apologize in advance if this thrasing causes you trouble.</p><h3>NavigationActions split up according to router</h3><p>If you are using <code>NavigationActions.push</code> or other stack-specific actions, you’ll need to import <code>StackActions</code> and use <code>StackActions.push</code> instead.</p><h2>Deprecations</h2><h3>XNavigator(...) is now createXNavigator(...)</h3><p><code>StackNavigator</code>, <code>TabNavigator</code> and <code>DrawerNavigator</code> are now deprecated in favour of <code>createStackNavigator</code>, <code>createTabNavigator</code>, and <code>createDrawerNavigator</code>, which are functionally identical but more clearly communicate that they are functions and that they return a component. The <code>XNavigator</code> style will removed in 3.0.</p><h3>Tab navigator split into separate components</h3><p>Previously, <code>TabNavigator</code> would render a navigation bar on the top of the screen on Android and the bottom on iOS. We’ve now pulled these navigators apart, so you can use <code>createBottomTabNavigator</code>and <code>createMaterialTopTabNavigator</code> explicitly depending on what you need. You can use <code>createTabNavigator</code> to have the same behavior as before, but it will be removed in 3.0.</p><p>It is worth noting additionally that <code>createBottomTabNavigator</code> is different from the bottom tab navigator that is available through <code>TabNavigator</code> in that it does not support <code>animationEnabled</code> or <code>swipeEnabled</code> properties.</p><h2>Enhancements</h2><ul><li>dangerouslyGetParent and dismiss helpers on navigation prop (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3669">3669</a>)</li><li>State persistence - automatically save state and reload it when the app restarts (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3716">3716</a>)</li><li>Smoothly transition header visibility in Stack (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3821">3821</a>)</li><li>Add initialRouteKey for StackRouter (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3540">3540</a>)</li><li>Make StackNavigator keyboard aware -- it hides automatically when you start to swipe back, and refocuses if you cancel the swipe back gesture (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3951">3951</a>)</li><li>Allow modification of SafeAreaView props in header (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3496">3496</a>)</li><li>Add <code>createMaterialBottomTabNavigator</code> for a material design style tab bar. (see <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-tabs">react-navigation-tabs</a>).</li><li>Use findIndex instead of map/indexOf in StateUtils (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/47fe858d4ec339d2b1f4b96f3a5444aed8f6f900">commit</a></li><li>Warn when users have multiple stateful navigation containers (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/68a2a106f370003dc1d46385fd8b5992be189ee2">commit</a>)</li><li>Remove almost all uses of React 16 deprecated lifecycle methods (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/3f837c895e823de4d528b55fd70ee7ba167480d8">commit</a>)</li><li>Add <code>activeLabelStyle</code> and <code>inactiveLabelStyle</code> for <code>DrawerItem</code> (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/7c488c8d4974028f85a4c5171d27209fa099170f">commit</a>)</li></ul><h2>Bugfixes</h2><ul><li>Avoid unnecessary navigation completion dispatches (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3902">3902</a>)</li><li>Use Header.HEIGHT instead of measuring to avoid flicker (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3940">3940</a>)</li><li>Implement paths on <code>SwitchRouter</code> (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/5e4512f3ebef587bf90e4ec4d660708b72a0a865">commit</a>).</li><li><code>SwitchRouter</code> now returns <code>null</code> on idempotent navigation (<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/577d99c1658ef85c061c82d55bf349c38e161e97">commit</a>).</li></ul><h2>Final notes</h2><p>The breaking changes and deprecations in this release resolve a lot of issues that users have encountered that have been perceived as bugs but were technically expected behavior. We think that we’ve drastically improved library ergonomics for new users and experienced users alike, let us know <a href="https://twitter.com/reactnavigation">on Twitter</a> what you think.</p><p>We’ve <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/3686">started to plan for 3.0</a>. Please get involved by <a href="https://react-navigation.canny.io/feature-requests">posting your feature requests to Canny</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/issues">opening a RFC</a>, or letting us know about bugs with a well-formulated <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/new">issue</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exactly two months after the release of React Navigation 1.0, we are close to another major version release. We’d like to invite developers that use the library to give the release candidate a try in your app and let us know if you encounter any issues.</p><pre><code>yarn add react-navigation@^2.0.0-rc.1
</code></pre><p>The documentation for 2.0 is available at <a href="https://reactnavigation.org/">https://reactnavigation.org/</a></p><p>We’re bumping the major version because some of the changes in this release are backwards incompatible. That said, this should be a fairly easy upgrade. We are improving React Navigation incrementally because we don&#x27;t want to leave developers feeling stranded in an old version. If you use React Navigation in a conventional way and don&#x27;t have any custom navigators, I can&#x27;t imagine this update would take you more than an hour.</p><p>This blog post is not a comprehensive changelog - that will come with the 2.0 proper release; the following is a list of the breaking changes, suggestions for how you can update your app to accommodate them, notice of deprecations, and some of my favourite new features.</p><h2>Breaking changes</h2><h3><code>navigate(routeName)</code> in StackNavigator is “less pushy”</h3><p>In 1.x, <code>navigate(routeName)</code> and <code>push(routeName)</code> were very similar: every time you called <code>navigate(routeName)</code> it would push a new route to the stack, regardless.

Alternatively, you could consider using a <code>key</code>: <code>navigate({routeName: ‘MyRoute’, key: data.uniqueId, params: data})</code>. <a href="/docs/2.x/navigation-key">Read more about navigation with keys</a>.</p><p>Read more about this in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0004-less-pushy-navigate.md">RFC 4</a>.</p><h3><code>push</code> now propagates between routers like <code>navigate</code></h3><p>Previously, <code>push</code> only applied to the deepest active stack router. This meant that if you had Stack A &gt; Stack B and Stack B fired <code>push(‘MyRoute’)</code>, even if Stack B does not have a route with the name <code>’MyRoute’</code> and Stack A does, the screen would not be pushed. We made this change to accommodate for the “less pushy” navigate behavior.</p><p>When updating your app, you may want to double check where you use <code>push</code>to ensure that this doesn’t impact the expected behavior of your app.</p><h3>Shallow navigation options</h3><p>A common source of confusion for developers working with React Navigation has been around <code>navigationOptions</code> resolution. For example, if you have a stack navigator with a header, and a drawer inside of that stack, then in some circumstances the title of the stack would change every time you change screens in the drawer. This is because the stack navigator would crawl into child navigators and pull <code>navigationOptions</code> off of the deepest active screen. As of 2.0, this no longer happens: navigators will only look at their direct children for <code>navigationOptions</code>. Read more about this in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0005-shallow-navigation-options.md">RFC 5</a>.</p><h3>New API for creating navigators</h3><p>This does not impact most users, but if you have any custom navigators in your app, read on. Read more about the changes in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-navigator-view-api.md">RFC 2</a>. Also read the <a href="/docs/2.x/custom-navigators">custom navigators documentation</a>.</p><h3>Drawer routes have been replaced with actions</h3><p>Rather than opening a drawer with <code>navigation.navigate(‘DrawerOpen’)</code>, you can now call <code>navigation.openDrawer()</code>. Other methods are <code>closeDrawer()</code> and <code>toggleDrawer()</code>.</p><h3>Navigation actions API overhaul</h3><p>In 1.x, functions on the <code>navigation</code> were not contextual - they would be the same regardless of whether your screen was inside of a drawer, a stack, a tab navigator, etc. In 2.0 the functions that are available to you on the <code>navigation</code> prop depend on the navigators that it corresponds to. If your screen is inside of both a stack and a drawer navigator, you will have helpers for both -- <code>push</code> and <code>openDrawer</code>, for example.</p><p>Given that we only exposed generic helpers (<code>navigate</code>, <code>goBack</code>) and helpers specific to the stack in 1.x, this would only impact you if you attempted to use the stack helpers from outside of a stack. For example, if you had a tab navigator with a stack in tab A and just a plain screen in tab B, then tried to <code>push</code> a route from the screen in tab B, <code>push</code> would not be available. Keep this in mind when you update your app if it follows this type of structure.</p><p>One of the big improvements you get from this is that you can now add your own helpers to the <code>navigation</code> prop!  Read more in <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0006-action-creators.md">RFC 6</a>.</p><h2>Deprecations</h2><p>The following APIs are deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.</p><h3>XNavigator is now named createXNavigator</h3><pre><code>import { createStackNavigator } from ‘react-navigation’;
createStackNavigator({routeName: Screen});
</code></pre><p>This change was made to improve the ease of learning and understanding the library. The navigator constructors are functions that return components (HOCs), and that was not previously very well communicated by the name.</p><h3><code>TabNavigator</code> has been split up into more focused navigators</h3><p><code>TabNavigator</code> (now <code>createTabNavigator</code> as per above) was a frequent source of confusion for users because it would use a bottom tab bar on iOS and a top tab bar on Android by default. Additionally, some of the configuration properties applied to the bottom tab bar, and others to the top tab bar. The equivalent components are now: <code>createBottomTabNavigator</code> and <code>createMaterialTopTabNavigator</code>. We’ve also introduced a new type of tab navigator, <code>createMaterialBottomTabNavigator</code> - a material design styled bottom tab bar based navigator from <a href="https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper">react-native-paper</a>. Thank you <a href="http://github.com/satya164">satya164</a> for your great work on this!</p><h2>New feature highlights</h2><ul><li>State persistence - automatically save state and reload it when the app restarts. See <a href="docs/state-persistence">state persistence docs</a></li><li>Transitions between screens in stack with headers and without headers now animates as expected on iOS. <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3821">https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/3821</a>. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/skevy">skevy</a>!</li><li>As mentioned above, <code>createMaterialBottomNavigator</code> is a new navigator type that provides the material design bottom tab bar pattern.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of today, React Navigation version 1.0 has been released! To see a list of recent improvements leading up to the release, refer to the “<a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/2585">Renewed Path to React Navigation V1.0</a>” issue. Thank you to everybody who has filed high-quality bug reports, submitted pull requests, and helped out fellow developers while we were in beta!</p><p>This release isn’t meant to be interpreted as a signal that React Navigation is “finished&quot; <!-- -->—<!-- --> work is already underway on a number of significant changes to the API that aim to make React Navigation easier to use and more powerful. These changes will be run through our <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs">new RFC process</a>. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-navigator-view-api.md">Navigator View API RFC</a> outlines a plan to decouple views from the router in order to make it easier for other navigation APIs, such as <a href="https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux">react-native-router-flux</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-native">react-router-native</a>, to build on top of the same navigation views. We’re also very excited about a plan (no RFC is open yet, but keep an eye out for it) to use <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler">react-native-gesture-handler</a> to run navigation gestures (sliding a drawer open, or swiping back on a stack, for example) on the UI thread using the Animated native driver.</p><p>Last week we released an updated version of our <a href="/docs/1.x/getting-started">documentation website</a>, built using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>. We hope that the new documentation will help newcomers get onboarded with the fundamentals of React Navigation, and serve as an ongoing resource to handle specific use cases as you come across them (under the “How do I do..?” section). <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io">Contributions to the documentation are very welcome</a>.</p><p><a href="/docs/1.x/getting-started">Give React Navigation 1.0 a try</a>, <a href="https://react-navigation.canny.io/feature-requests">post a feature request</a> if you think something is missing, <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs">open a RFC</a> if you have an idea of how to implement it, <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues">file a detailed bug report</a> when you encounter problems (or <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pulls">open a pull request</a> if you know how to fix them)! Updating your existing installation should be easy if you have tracked releases over recent months <!-- -->—<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/1.0.0">read the brief release notes</a> for more information.</p>]]></content:encoded>
